## Background:
Mortgages, student and auto loans, and debt consolidation are just a few examples of credit and loans that people seek online. Peer-to-peer lending services such as Loans Canada and Mogo let investors loan people money without using a bank. However, because investors always want to mitigate risk, a client has asked that you help them predict credit risk with machine learning techniques.

## Files:
1) Resampling Notebook
2) Ensemble Notebook
3) Lending Club Loans Data

## Steps:
1) Read the data into a DataFrame

2) Split the data into training and testing sets

3) Scale the training and testing data using the StandardScaler
4) Generate a classification report using the imbalanced_classification_report

8) For the balanced random forest classifier only, print the feature importance sorted in descending order



## Questions:
1) Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
2) Which model had the best recall score?
3) Which model had the best geometric mean score?
4) What are the top three features?
